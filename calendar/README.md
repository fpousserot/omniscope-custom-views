# ![](icon.svg) Calendar

Custom view that shows yearly calendars in a grid with cells coloured by a measure.

The visualisation aggregates all rows with the same date and marks the dates with data with lighter blue for lower values and darker blue for higher values. It will show all consecutive years in the dataset, adding any missing ones.

The dataset consists of rows with a date value and a numerical value to colour by.
