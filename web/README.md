# ![](icon.svg) Web

Custom view that shows a web page using an iFrame.

The view navigates to the web page according to the current selection / filter state.
If multiple records with multiple URLs are selected the view won't show any content.
You can play with the URL setting in the view options to control this behaviour (e.g. by changing which function to apply on the field)
