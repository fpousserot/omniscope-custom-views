# ![](icon.svg) Beeswarm

Custom view that shows non-overlapping coloured points positioned along the x-axis and y-axis.

The visualisation can be used to show the distribution of values in a dataset preserving the resolution of every data point rather than displaying aggregated (clustering, histogram) or overlapped (scatter) data.
This focuses on singularity and accumulation over accuracy.

The dataset consists of rows with an id value, optional numerical x and y values and categorical value to colour by.
